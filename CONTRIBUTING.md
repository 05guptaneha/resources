# Contributors' Guide
üí™üëç First off, thanks for taking your time to contribute, you are amazing! üëçüí™

This is a growing list of *resources* for learning and improving as a developer and/or designer and we want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is:

- Adding Learning Resources
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

### Prerequisites

- Git or any equivalent Version Control System (GitKraten, GitHub Desktop e.t.c)
- Code Editor (VsCode, Sublime Text, Atom e.t.c)
- Little command line knowledge
- The zeal to share learning resources with others :blush:

## Getting Started

1.  If you are new to Git and Github, it is advisable you go through
    [**GitHub For Beginners**](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)
    before moving to the next step.

2.  Also go through [**Contributing to Github**](GitandGitHub_Resources/Contributing_to_GitHub.md) if you are new to contributing to open source projects on GitHub.
    
3.  Fork this Repository [**here**](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/resources/fork)

4.  Clone the forked Repository <br>
`git clone https://github.com/Your-GitHub-Username/resources.git`

5.  Open the cloned directory in your Code Editor.

6. Add your name to the [**Contributors List**](CONTRIBUTORS.md) in the root directory.

## Adding Learning Resources

### STEP ONE

1.  We have created a list of markdown (`.md`) files for different categories of learning resources. Find the category/categories related to the resources you want to add in the root directory

2.  Check if the resources you want to add is already included. If not, then you can proceed!

3.  Add your resources at the end, following the code pattern of the already existing resources. It should include:
* **Name** of the resources (as a link to the resource page)
* **A brief description** of it's content and other related information.<br> 
Here are **some examples**: <br>
    `>> [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/): A 30-day coding challenge in which you will build 30 things using vanilla JavaScript`

    `>> [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS): No matter how much experience you have with JavaScript, odds are you don‚Äôt fully understand the language. These concise yet in-depth guides take you inside core concepts that can help you become a more efficient and effective JavaScript programmer. This is a series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language.`

    `>> [mmtuts](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCharmefis/featured): **_mmtuts_** (a.k.a MultiMedia Tutorials) aims to provide tutorials spanning the gamut of programming, video editing/production, animation, and graphic design.`

4.  If you feel like the resources you want to add should be in a non-existing category/categories. kindly [**open an issue**](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/resources/issues) to let project maintainers know of this new category before creating one.
